# Getting Started

This guide will help you create your first Float.js application.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or later
- pnpm, npm, or yarn

## Create a New Project

The easiest way to get started is using `create-float`:

```bash
pnpm create float my-app
```

You'll be prompted to choose a template:

- **basic** - Simple React app to get started quickly
- **full** - Full-featured app with file-based routing
- **api** - API-focused template with backend routes

## Project Structure

After creating your project, you'll see this structure:

```
my-app/
├── src/
│   ├── App.tsx          # Main app component
│   └── entry-client.tsx # Client entry point
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── .gitignore
```

## Development

Navigate to your project and install dependencies:

```bash
cd my-app
pnpm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Your app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Hot Module Replacement

Float.js includes lightning-fast HMR out of the box. Edit any file in `src/` and see changes instantly - typically in under 50ms.

## TypeScript Support

Float.js includes full TypeScript support with no configuration needed. Just write `.tsx` or `.ts` files and everything works.
